This is my (work in progress) professional portfolio written in ReactJS and hosted
on AWS using serverless components. I am building this in conjunction with the
[A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/) 'Create a Serverless Portfolio with AWS and React'
course taught by Robin Norwood. This is my real first dive into programming (I'm an Ops
guy by trade) so please bear with me as I learn, make mistakes, and hopefully improve.
Please feel free to comment, critique and let me know where I can do better. This is
an educational exercise for me, so feedback is welcomed!
